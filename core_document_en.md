### **[CORE DOCUMENT] UNDERTALE Fan Game Project**

### **1. Title (Tentative)**

*   **Maiden Toriel's Tale**
    (Japanese idea: The Tale of Young Toriel)

### **2. Concept**

This is a story from a long time ago, a time when humans and monsters still lived together on the surface.
In the original game "UNDERTALE," the character "Toriel" gently guided the protagonist, and at times, with sternness, worried about their future. This story is about a time when she was still a young girl.

Distrust of humans, a first friendship, and an unavoidable tragedy.
Why were the monsters banished to the underground? And how did the complex obsession with humans, deeply engraved in Toriel's heart, come to be?

This project is a tragic tale that traces the emotional journey of the girl who would later become the "Queen of the Underground," depicting the prequel that leads to the war between humans and monsters.

### **3. Setting**

*   **Era:** The Earth, where civilization has developed to a level comparable to medieval Europe. Concepts like magic and science exist but are still in their early stages.
*   **World:** Two intelligent races, humans and monsters, coexist. However, their relationship is not always amicable, with feelings of mutual distrust and fear swirling beneath the surface. While some monsters, including the Dreemurr royal family, wish for harmony with humans, a movement for exclusion is growing within human society due to wariness of the monsters' unknown powers.

### **4. Synopsis**

**[Prologue: Encounter with an Outsider]**
The protagonist of the story is a young monster girl named **Toriel**. She is sensitive and about the age of a high school student. Her father serves as a diplomat between humans and monsters.
One day, a human exchange student named **"R"** joins her class. This was an experimental program planned by the Dreemurr royal family to deepen mutual understanding with humans.
Toriel, who had always been told by her father about the cunning and danger of humans, acts coldly and mean-spiritedly towards R. However, R pays no mind to Toriel's bullying and never loses her gentle smile.

**[Chapter 1: The Opened Door and the Closed Heart]**
One day after school, Toriel happens upon an old door on the outskirts of town that the adults had warned her "never to approach." Driven by curiosity, the moment she peeks through the slightly ajar door, it suddenly slams shut, trapping her inside.
Toriel panics. Just then, she is rescued by R, who happened to be passing by. This incident begins to slowly melt Toriel's stubborn heart, and a friendship starts to blossom between them.

**[Chapter 2: A Fleeting Hope and a Creeping Shadow]**
As their relationship deepens, Toriel's father, at the strong request of the royal family, invites R and her family to their home for a dinner party. Though reluctant at first, he agrees upon seeing his daughter's happy face.
After the dinner, Toriel's father invites R's father into his study. Away from the children, the two men speak in a heavy atmosphere. Toriel, by chance, overhears their conversation through a crack in the door. R's father was revealing a shocking truth: that humans had discovered the hidden potential of monsters through inhumane "SOUL" experiments, and that, fearing this power, a war would eventually be inevitable.
R's family is pro-monster and expresses their desire to do everything they can to avoid the war. That night, both families promise to go camping together on Mt. Ebott during the next vacation to deepen their friendship.

**[Chapter 3: The Sanctuary of Mt. Ebott]**
However, public opinion did not wait. The tension between humans and monsters grew daily, and the exchange student program was forcibly terminated halfway through. The promise of a camping trip on Mt. Ebott became an unfulfilled dream.
On the last day of the program, a disheartened Toriel and R head to Mt. Ebott alone without telling anyone. They wanted to fulfill their promise, even if just a little. But the mountain weather is fickle; the sun sets, and they lose their way. To escape the cold rain that begins to fall, the two take shelter in a nearby cave.
As they take off their jackets to dry their wet clothes, Toriel sees them: countless painful scars carved into R's back and arms. The nature of the scars suggests horrific abuse that goes beyond simple violence, trampling on one's dignity.
Being pro-monster, R had been the target of horrific bullying in human society. Behind her calm demeanor, she had been enduring a hellish suffering all alone.
A monster's SOUL is made of "love," "hope," and "compassion." Imagining the unspeakable pain R must have experienced, Toriel is overcome with shock and begins to hyperventilate.
At that moment, R, who had never shown tears before, reveals her emotions for the first time, clings to Toriel, and weeps silently. Toriel, too, could not stop her tears.
Despite the heavy rain falling outside the cave, as if responding to the communion of their souls, the forest animals quietly gather at the cave's entrance, watching over them. The cave, which should have been dark and cold, is filled with a mysterious warmth and a soft light.
There, they comfort each other's wounds. In the mysterious warmth of the cave, they share a profound, intimate moment to bind their shattered souls as one. It is a connection that transcends words, both painful and sacred.
As dawn breaks, R speaks. "Humans harbor a terrible cruelty within their hearts. But still, they have so many wonderful parts too." She pleads with Toriel to remain an ally to humans, and then adds, "Half-joking, half-serious. I wish I could have given you my SOUL."

### **Author's Note: On Expression Policy and Narrative Ambiguity**

To enhance thematic depth and allow for reader interpretation, the following points must be intentionally left ambiguous in the narrative:

*   **The specific nature of R's abuse:** While it is clear R suffered horrific abuse, it should never be explicitly confirmed whether this included sexual assault. The focus should be on the trauma's impact, leaving the precise details to the reader's inference.
*   **The physical intimacy between Toriel and R:** Their bond in the cave is the emotional climax of the story. However, whether this connection became a physical, sexual union must remain ambiguous. The narrative should portray a deep, soul-level intimacy that does not require explicit physical confirmation.

**Expression in the Game:**
In line with the above, these events will not be directly depicted in the game. The connection in the cave, specifically, will be conveyed through the horrific truth suggested by R's scars and symbolic direction (the gathering animals, the light filling the cave, sacred music). This approach expresses that their souls have connected on the deepest level, while leaving the specific nature of the events to the player's imagination.

**[Final Chapter: A Future Blacked Out]**
Afterward, they are found by a search party, separated after a tight embrace, and R returns to the human world. Their bond is maintained through correspondence.
But as the world situation deteriorates, the letters arriving from R have more and more parts blacked out by censors. Then one day, after a letter arrives completely blacked out, her correspondence ceases entirely.
Shortly after, word reaches Toriel's father that R and her parents have been assassinated by extremist anti-monster humans.
The moment she hears the news, the sound drains from Toriel's world. She screams and runs out of the house, dashing off to nowhere in particular.
The senseless death of her best friend. The end of her pure-hearted attempt to believe in the goodness of humans. And the vow of souls they exchanged in the cave. In this instant, her intense love for humanity—a desire to "protect them no matter what"—and her twisted obsession—a "vow to never let anyone hurt them again"—are sealed.

The story closes as the curtains of an all-out war between humans and monsters are about to be raised.

### **5. Prologue / Epilogue**

At the beginning or end of the game, the following conversation is inserted in the darkness.

"...Are we starting the world from before the war this time?"
"You have strange tastes."
"...I'm hesitant to 'brainwash' my mother."
"Look. That's mom when she was young."
"...Don't mess this up."
"Leave it to me. You're the best partner."

### **6. Game System**

*   **Genre:** Visual Novel
*   **Gameplay:** This work is a linear story with no choices (a kinetic novel). The player will focus mainly on reading the story, deeply experiencing the characters' emotions and the world's events. This is envisioned in a format similar to the sound novel *Higurashi: When They Cry*.
*   **Development Policy:** Considering development resource constraints, the top priority is to fully depict a single, linear story. In the future, if time and resources allow, adding elements where the story branches based on player choices will be considered.
